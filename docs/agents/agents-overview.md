# Agents Overview

## AI in Warp

Warp includes intelligent agents designed to help you build, test, deploy, and debug â€” all while keeping you in control. Agents can look up commands, execute tasks, fix bugs, and adapt to your workflows. You can manage agent behavior directly, with full context from your Warp Drive and your team.
