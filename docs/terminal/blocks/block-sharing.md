# Block Sharing

This action sends command information to our server and is explicitly opt-in. Read more about privacy at Warp on [our privacy page](https://www.warp.dev/privacy).

Share your blocks with a permalink or HTML embed. You can get started with shared blocks by opening the context menu and copying the command, output, or prompt.

## Permalink

## Embedded Blocks

Create and embed your blocks on web pages to help your readers follow along with technical writing. Readers can interact with an embedded block as they would with a block in Warp, with a context menu and styling. When you click "Get embed", Warp will copy an `iframe` to your clipboard. Here's an example `iframe`:

```html
<iframe src="https://app.warp.dev/block/embed/qn0g1CqQnkYjEafPH5HCVT"
title="server script error" style="width: 712px; height: 397px; border:0;
overflow:hidden;" allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"></iframe>
```

## Managing Shared Blocks

You can unshare a block by navigating to `Settings > Shared blocks`. Currently, shared blocks are accessible to anyone with the link.

## Link Previews

Shared permalinks will also display a preview of your code for quick context on each link.
