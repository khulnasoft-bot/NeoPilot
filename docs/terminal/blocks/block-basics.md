# Block Basics

## The Basics

* Blocks group your command and command output
* The Input Editor can pin to the bottom, pin to the top, or start at the top.
* Blocks grow from the bottom to the top.
* Blocks are color-coded. Blocks that quit with a non-zero exit code have a red background and red sidebar.

{% hint style="info" %}
Try it yourself!\
Type `xyz` (or some other command that doesn’t exist) and hit `ENTER`
{% endhint %}

## Create A Block

1. Execute a command (type `ls` and hit `ENTER`) in the Input Editor at the bottom of the screen.
2. Your command and output are grouped into a Block.
3. Try executing a different command (type `echo hello` and hit `ENTER`).
4. Warp adds your newly created Block to the bottom (directly above the input editor).

## Navigate Blocks

* Either scroll using your mouse or the scrollbar or select a Block and use the `UP ↑` and `DOWN ↓` arrow keys.
* "Scroll Terminal output up/down one line" is also a way to navigate block output, and can be configured with a keyboard shortcut or accessed from the [Command Palette](../command-palette).
* When the output of a command is cut off, Warp keeps the [Sticky Command Header](sticky-command-header) pinned at the top that displays the command the Block corresponds to. Clicking the header will scroll the screen to the start of the Block.
