  - [x] Add module-level documentation for the main UI modules.
- [ ] Add more detailed comments to complex or critical sections of the code, especially in the AI and rendering pipelines.
  - [x] Add high-level comments to the AI and rendering pipelines.
- [x] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide for new contributors.
- [x] Document the purpose and usage of each of the `generators`.

## üß™ Testing

- [ ] Increase test coverage for critical components like the terminal model, UI rendering, and AI logic.
  - [x] Set up basic testing environment and add a simple test.
- [ ] Add integration tests for user workflows, such as creating and running commands, using the AI assistant, and managing notebooks.
  - [x] Create basic integration test file for workflows.
  - [x] Create basic integration test file for notebooks.
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and catch regressions.
  - [x] Outline a high-level plan for E2E testing.
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests on every commit.
  - [x] Outline a high-level plan for CI/CD.
- [ ] Add performance benchmark tests to track and prevent regressions.
  - [x] Outline a high-level plan for performance benchmarking.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

- [ ] Analyze and refactor complex modules with high cyclomatic complexity.
  - [x] Attempted to use `rust-code-analysis` but encountered dependency resolution issues.
- [ ] Consolidate and deduplicate redundant code, especially in the `settings` and `themes` modules.
  - [x] Outlined areas for consolidation in `settings` and `themes` modules.
- [ ] Improve the separation of concerns between the UI, application logic, and terminal core.
  - [x] Outline a high-level plan for improving separation of concerns.
- [ ] Evaluate and potentially replace deprecated dependencies.
  - [x] Ran `cargo audit` to check for vulnerabilities (none found). Further manual checks might be needed as the project grows.
- [x] Refactor the `legacy.rs` and `v0.rs` files to either remove or modernize the old code.

## ‚ú® Features

- [ ] Enhance the AI assistant with more advanced capabilities, such as context-aware suggestions and command generation.
  - [x] Outline a high-level plan for enhancing the AI assistant.
- [ ] Expand the library of `generators` with more tools and frameworks.
